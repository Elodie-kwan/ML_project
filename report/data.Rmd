## Import dataset 
```{r}
Mountain_data <- read_excel("1-s2.0-S2352340919311710-mmc1.xlsx", sheet = "FieldDATA")
Mountain_data$Date <- as.Date(Mountain_data$Date, "%d/%m/%Y")

head(Mountain_data)
str(Mountain_data)
```


We are deleting the variables that are not useful for use. The variables such as the **UTM grid zone**, **UTM_X** and **UTM_Y** are related to the samples and we are not wanting to make predictions based on those characteristics but rather on the actual soil composition. 
The variable **Elevation**, **slope**, **plot_ID**, **Orientation** will not help us neither because it is related to the place where the sample has been taken. It is a certain amount above the some tree limits.

```{r}

Mountain_data <- Mountain_data[, c(2:5, 7:11, 18:42)]
str(Mountain_data)
```
