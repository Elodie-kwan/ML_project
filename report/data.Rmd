## Part 1 : Data Preparation

In this first part, we will first download the data into R. Then, we will apply the necessary transformations on these data so that they can be correctly exploited for the following analysis. 

#### Import dataset 
Below is the first 4 observations of the datasets. 

```{r echo=F,results='asis',error=F,warning=F}
Mountain_data <- read_excel("../data/1-s2.0-S2352340919311710-mmc1.xlsx", sheet = "FieldDATA")
Mountain_data$Date <- as.Date(Mountain_data$Date, "%d/%m/%Y")
```

```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}

Mountain_data_loc <- Mountain_data%>% select("Country":"Locality","Plot_ID", "Grid zone":"UTM_Y")
Mountain_data_loc <- Mountain_data_loc[!duplicated(Mountain_data_loc[,c("UTM_X","UTM_Y")]),]

Mountain_data_loc$`Grid zone`<- gsub('.{2}$', '', Mountain_data_loc$`Grid zone`)
Mountain_data_loc$`Grid zone`<- as.numeric(Mountain_data_loc$`Grid zone`)

Mountain_data_loc_Guadarrama <- Mountain_data_loc %>% filter(`Muntain Range`== "Sierra de Guadarrama")
v1 <- vect(as.matrix(Mountain_data_loc_Guadarrama[,6:7]), crs= "+proj=utm +zone=30 +datum=WGS84  +units=m")
y1 <- project(v1, "+proj=longlat +datum=WGS84")
lonlat <- as.data.frame(geom(y1)[, c("x", "y")])
Mountain_data_loc_Guadarrama[,6:7] <- lonlat
colnames(Mountain_data_loc_Guadarrama)[6:7]<- c("lon", "lat")

Mountain_data_loc_Pyrenees <- Mountain_data_loc %>% filter(`Muntain Range`== "Central Pyrenees")

Mountain_data_loc_Pyrenees1 <- Mountain_data_loc_Pyrenees %>% filter(`Grid zone`== 30)
v1 <- vect(as.matrix(Mountain_data_loc_Pyrenees1[,6:7]), crs= "+proj=utm +zone=30 +datum=WGS84  +units=m")
y1 <- project(v1, "+proj=longlat +datum=WGS84")
lonlat <- as.data.frame(geom(y1)[, c("x", "y")])
Mountain_data_loc_Pyrenees1[,6:7] <- lonlat
colnames(Mountain_data_loc_Pyrenees1)[6:7]<- c("lon", "lat")

Mountain_data_loc_Pyrenees2 <- Mountain_data_loc_Pyrenees %>% filter(`Grid zone`== 31)
v1 <- vect(as.matrix(Mountain_data_loc_Pyrenees2[,6:7]), crs= "+proj=utm +zone=31 +datum=WGS84  +units=m")
y1 <- project(v1, "+proj=longlat +datum=WGS84")
lonlat <- as.data.frame(geom(y1)[, c("x", "y")])
Mountain_data_loc_Pyrenees2[,6:7] <- lonlat
colnames(Mountain_data_loc_Pyrenees2)[6:7]<- c("lon", "lat")

Mountain_data_loc_Pyrenees <- rbind(Mountain_data_loc_Pyrenees1, Mountain_data_loc_Pyrenees2)


Mountain_data_loc_Andes <- Mountain_data_loc %>% filter(`Muntain Range`== "Central Andes")
v1 <- vect(as.matrix(Mountain_data_loc_Andes[,6:7]), crs= "+proj=utm  +datum=WGS84 +zone=19 +south" )
y1 <- project(v1, "+proj=longlat +south +zone=19")
lonlat <- as.data.frame(geom(y1)[, c("x", "y")])
Mountain_data_loc_Andes[,6:7] <- lonlat
colnames(Mountain_data_loc_Andes)[6:7]<- c("lon", "lat")

rm(v1, y1, lonlat, Mountain_data_loc_Pyrenees1, Mountain_data_loc_Pyrenees2, Mountain_data_loc)
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
kable(head(Mountain_data[,1:11]), format = "markdown")
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
kable(head(Mountain_data[,12:22]), format = "markdown")
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
kable(head(Mountain_data[,23:32]), format = "markdown")
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
kable(head(Mountain_data[,33:42]), format = "markdown")
```

We are deleting the variables that are not useful for use. The variables such as the **UTM grid zone**, **UTM_X** and **UTM_Y** are related to the samples and we are not wanting to make predictions based on those characteristics but rather on the actual soil composition. 
The variable **Elevation**, **slope**, **plot_ID**, **Orientation** will not help us neither because it is related to the place where the sample has been taken. It is a certain amount above the some tree limits.
We rename the variable **Muntain Range** as **Mountain_range** to facilitate future use. 

After these changes, he database *Mountain_data* is composed of 430 observation and 34 variables.

```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
Mountain_data <- Mountain_data[, c(2:5, 7:11, 18:42)]
colnames(Mountain_data)[2] <- "Mountain_range"
```

Now that we have the variables we want to work with, we see that they are all considered as numeric. However, we know that some of them should be categorical as they have different levels. We are going to transform **Country**, **Mountain_Range**, **Locality**, **Plot** and **Subplot** as factors. 

```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
Mountain_data$Country <- as.factor(Mountain_data$Country)
Mountain_data$Mountain_range <- as.factor(Mountain_data$Mountain_range)
Mountain_data$Locality <- as.factor(Mountain_data$Locality)
Mountain_data$Plot <- as.factor(Mountain_data$Plot)
Mountain_data$Subplot <- as.factor(Mountain_data$Subplot)
```

We can export this cleaned dataset on the _data_ folder of our project. 

```{r inchlude = FALSE}
write.csv(Mountain_data,"../data/Mountain_data_cleaned.csv", row.names = FALSE)
```

<br />
For a better representation of the data we created 3 maps with each icon representing a subsample belonging to a larger sample. Each map represents a mountain region, two in Spain and one in Chile.

### Sierra de Guadarrama (Spain)
##### Mediterranean climate

```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, out.width = "100%", fig.align="center"}

map1 <- leaflet() %>%
  addTiles() %>%  
  addMarkers(lng=Mountain_data_loc_Guadarrama$lon, lat=Mountain_data_loc_Guadarrama$lat, popup=paste("Locality: ",Mountain_data_loc_Guadarrama$Locality,"<br/>", "Sample n° ", Mountain_data_loc_Guadarrama$Plot_ID))
map1 

```
<br />
<br />

### Central Pyrenees (Spain)
##### temperate climate 

```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, out.width = "100%", fig.align="center"}

map2 <- leaflet() %>%
  addTiles() %>%  
  addMarkers(lng=Mountain_data_loc_Pyrenees$lon, lat=Mountain_data_loc_Pyrenees$lat, popup=paste("Locality: ",Mountain_data_loc_Pyrenees$Locality,"<br/>", "Sample n° ", Mountain_data_loc_Pyrenees$Plot_ID))

```
<br />
<br />

### Chilean Andes (Chile)
##### Mediterranean climate 

```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, out.width = "100%", fig.align="center"}

map3 <- leaflet() %>%
  addTiles() %>%  
  addMarkers(lng=Mountain_data_loc_Andes$lon, lat=Mountain_data_loc_Andes$lat, popup=paste("Locality: ",Mountain_data_loc_Andes$Locality,"<br/>", "Sample n° ", Mountain_data_loc_Andes$Plot_ID))
